# Book-Search-Engine


## Description

Book Search Engine is a site in which users can search for any book title or author, and search results containing their query will appear below.  It is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes. The main page shows new users a menu, with which they can search for books, login, or signup.Registered users can also save books to their accounts, or delete saved books from their accounts.
 In this project, I integrate a GraphQL API into a fully functioning book engine that was built using the MERN stack, replacing the previous RESTful API.<br>
 Also the application is deployed on Heroku. you can find links below.
